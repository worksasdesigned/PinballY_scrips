# Meta_Filter

Here you find 3 simple example Filters
- only unrated games
- only >3 stars
- only >4 stars

Pinbally standard Filters do not stack. This means if you first select "Only Visual PinballX" as system
and afterwards you select "3 Stars" as Filter --> You get ALL Tables (incl. FX3 and FP) with 3 stars.

MetaFilter narrow the result. If you again first select "Only Visual PinballX" and than select the MetaFilter ">3stars".
You get ONLY Visual PinballX tables with more than 3 stars.

You can easily change the 3 existing filters to the criterias you want or add some additional ones.
